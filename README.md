If I had more time I would:
 * Add logging
 * Display election data in a nicer way
 * Add augmentation service to fetch more ocd-ids (I was thinking of calling a service to lookup county by address)
 * Improve request response to provide useful feedback (input data wasn't complete or no data available)
